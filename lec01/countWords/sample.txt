In the land of code, where logic does reign,
Java stands tall, clear and plain.
Objects and classes, methods that call,
Inheritance links them all.

With Scanner in hand, we parse the text,
String.split() to slice what's next.
Command lines guide the program's flow,
In Java's world, the possibilities grow.

Loops and conditions, decisions we make,
Java compiles with every mistake.
From "Hello, World!" to complex arrays,
Coding in Java brightens our days.

So write your code, let functions thrive,
In Java's realm, the programs come alive.
Debug, compile, then run with pride,
For in Java, there's no bug to hide.
